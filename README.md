# FishTankSimulation
A fish tank simulation made with cellular automata. 
## How it works?
A random population is generated, then many generations are passed. <br>
0 represents water, 1 represents fish, 2 represents sharks.<br>
After an image is saved with the simulation, white represents water, grey is fish, and black is sharks.
## Samples
Generation 0 <br>
